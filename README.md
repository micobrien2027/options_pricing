# üß† Options Pricing in C++

This project implements several numerical and analytical methods for pricing European and American options in C++. It includes:

- Black-Scholes Model (closed-form)
- Binomial Tree (American + European support)
- Monte Carlo Simulation (with confidence intervals)
- Calculation of Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega)
- CSV Export of results

## Why This Project?

In quantitative finance and derivatives trading, it‚Äôs critical to understand **how different pricing methods work** and their trade-offs. This project:

- Shows how **analytical**, **discrete**, and **stochastic** models compare
- Demonstrates **numerical convergence** and **Monte Carlo uncertainty**
- Calculates **Greeks**, essential for hedging and risk management
- Outputs results in **human-readable and machine-readable formats** (terminal + CSV)
